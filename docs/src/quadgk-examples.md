# `quadgk` examples

The following are several examples illustrating the usage of the main [`quadgk`](@ref) numerical-integration function of QuadGK, focusing on more complicated circumstances than the smooth scalar integral of the [Quick start](@ref) section.

## Improper integrals: Infinite limits

`quadgk` supports "improper" integrals over infinite and semi-infinite intervals,
simply by passing `±Inf` for the endpoints.

For example, $\int_0^\infty e^{-x} dx = 1$ is computed by:
```
julia> quadgk(x -> exp(-x), 0, Inf)
(1.0, 4.507383379289404e-11)
```
which give gives the correct answer (1) exactly in this case.  Note that
the error estimate `≈ 4.5e-11` is pessimistic, as is often the case.

The [Gaussian integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral)
$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} = 1.772453850905516027298167483341\ldots$ is computed by:
```
julia> quadgk(x -> exp(-x^2), -Inf, Inf)
(1.7724538509055137, 6.4296367126505234e-9)
```
which is the correct answer to nearly [machine precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon), despite the pessimistic error estimate `≈ 6.4e-9`.

Internally, `quadgk` handles infinite limits by the [changes of variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution)
```math
\int_a^\infty f(x)dx = \int_0^1 f\left(a + \frac{t}{1-t}\right) \frac{1}{(1-t)^2} dt
```
and
```math
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)dx = \int_{-1}^1 f\left(\frac{t}{1-t^2}\right) \frac{1+t^2}{(1-t^2)^2} dt
```
respectively.   Although the transformed integrands are singular at the endpoints
$t = 1$ and $t = \pm 1$, respectively, because the singularities are integrable
and `quadgk` *never evaluates the integrand exactly at the endpoints*, it is able
to perform the numerical integration successfully.

## Counting and printing integrand evaluations

Often, it is a good idea to count the number of times the integrand is evaluated,
in order to have a sense of how efficiently `quadgk` is performing the integral;
this is especially useful with badly behaved integrand (e.g. with singularities,
discontinuities, sharp spikes, and/or rapid oscillations) to see whether some
transformation of the problem might be helpful (see below).

This is easy enough by simply incrementing a global counter in your integrand
function and printing progress as desired.    But it is such a common desire
in pedagogy and debugging that we provide convenience functions [`quadgk_count`](@ref)
and [`quadgk_print`](@ref) to automate this task.

For example, in our $\int_0^\infty e^{-x} dx$ example from above, we could do:
```
julia> quadgk_count(x -> exp(-x), 0, Inf)
(1.0, 4.507383379289404e-11, 135)
```
to return the number of function evaluations (`135`) along with the integral (`1.0`)
and error estimate (`≈ 4.5e-11`).   A relatively large number of function evaluations
are required, even though the function $e^{-x}$ is very smooth, because the infinite
endpoint implicitly introduces a singularity (via the change of variables discussed
above).

We can also print the evaluation points, setting a lower requested relative accuracy of `rtol=1e-2` so that we don't get so much output, by:
```
julia> quadgk_print(x -> exp(-x), 0, Inf, rtol=1e-2)
f(0.026110451522445993) = 0.9742274787577301
f(38.29883980138536) = 2.3282264081806294e-17
f(0.00429064542600238) = 0.9957185462423211
f(233.06516868994527) = 6.04064500678147e-102
f(0.14841469193194298) = 0.8620735458624529
f(6.737877409458626) = 0.0011851600983136456
f(0.07246402202084404) = 0.9300992091482783
f(13.799951646519888) = 1.015680581505947e-6
f(0.42263178703605514) = 0.6553198859704107
f(2.3661258586654506) = 0.09384358625528809
f(0.26096469051417465) = 0.7703081183184751
f(3.831936029467112) = 0.021667625834125973
f(1.0) = 0.36787944117144233
f(0.655923922306948) = 0.5189623601162878
f(1.52456705113438) = 0.21771529605384055
(0.9999887201849575, 0.0009180738585039538, 15)
```
to see that (for a relatively low requested relative accuracy of `rtol=1e-2`) it
evaluates the integrand only 15 times at points from $x \approx 0.00429$ to $x \approx 233.1$, and still managed to get about 5 significant digits correct.  (Note that
`quadgk_print` again returns a 3-element tuple, like `quadgk_count`, where the
third element is the number of integrand evaluations.)

## Integrands with singularities and discontinuities

The integral $\int_0^1 x^{-1/2} dx = \left. 2 \sqrt{x} \right|_0^1 = 2$ is perfectly finite even though the integrand $1/\sqrt{x}$ blows up at $x=0$.  This is an example
of an *integrable singularity*, and `quadgk` can compute this integral:
```
julia> quadgk_count(x -> 1/sqrt(x), 0, 1)
(1.9999999845983916, 2.3762511924588765e-8, 1305)
```
Notice the large number (`1305`) of integrand evaluations returned by
[`quadgk_count`](@ref): this is an indication of how much more work it
is to evaluate an integral with a singularity or any other form of non-smoothness.
At its heart, the Gauss–Kronrod algorithm employed by `quadgk` works by
interpolating the integrand with polynomials over segments of the domain,
and polynomials are bad at representing [non-analytic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function) like $1/\sqrt{x}$.

The good news is that `quadgk` **never evaluates functions exactly at the endpoints**,
so it is okay if your function blows up or errors at those points.   However,
this means that if you function blows up in the *interior* of the integration domain,
you should *add an extra "endpoint"* at that point to make sure we never evaluate it.
(Also, `quadgk` can often converge more quickly if you tell it where your singularities
are via the endpoints.)  For example, suppose we are integrating
$\int_0^2 |x-1|^{-1/2} dx = 4$, which has an (integrable) singularity at $x=1$.
If we don't tell `quadgk` about the singularity, it gets "unlucky" and evaluates
the integrand exactly at $x=1$, which ends up throwing an error:
```
julia> quadgk_count(x -> 1/sqrt(abs(x-1)), 0, 2)
ERROR: DomainError with 1.0:
integrand produced NaN in the interval (0, 2)
...
```
Instead, if we *tell* it to subdivide the integral at $x=1$, we get the correct answer(`≈ 4`):
```
julia> quadgk_count(x -> 1/sqrt(abs(x-1)), 0, 1, 2)
(3.9999999643041515, 5.8392038954259235e-8, 2580)
```

In general, the syntax `quadgk(f, a, b, c, ...)` denotes the integral
$\int_a^b f(x)dx + \int_b^c f(x)dx  + \cdots$, and `quadgk` never evaluates
the integrand $f(x)$ exactly at the endpoints $a, b, c, \ldots$.

As another example, consider an integral $\int_0^3 H(x-1) = 2$ of the discontinuous
[Heaviside step function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function)
$H(x)$, which $=1$ when $x > 0$ and $=0$ when $x \le 0$:
```
julia> quadgk_count(x -> x > 1, 0, 3)
(2.0000000043200235, 1.7916158219741817e-8, 705)
```
Even though $H(x-1)$ is nearly constant, `quadgk` struggles to integrate it (`705`
function evaluations to get about 8 digits), thanks to the discontinuity at $x=1$.
(Note that `true` and `false` in Julia are equal to numeric `0` and `1`, which is
why we could implement $H(x-1)$ as simply `x > 1`.)
On the other hand, if we *tell it* the location of the discontinuity:
```
julia> quadgk_count(x -> x > 1, 0, 1, 3)
(2.0, 0.0, 30)
```
then it gives the *exact* answer in only 30 evaluations.  The reason it takes
30 evaluations is because `quadgk` defaults to 7th-order Gauss–Kronrod integration
rule, which uses 15 points to interpolate with a high-degree polynomial.  Once
we subdivide the integral, we could actually get away with a lower-order rule
by setting the `order` parameter, e.g.:
```
julia> quadgk_count(x -> x > 1, 0, 1, 3, order=1)
(2.0, 0.0, 6)
```

## Complex and vector-valued integrands

The integrand `f(x)` can return not just real numbers, but also complex numbers, vectors, matrices, or any Julia type supporting `±`, multiplication by scalars, and `norm` (i.e. implementing any [Banach space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space)).

For example, we can integrate $1/\sqrt{x}$ from $x=-1$ to $x=1$, where we
[tell the `sqrt` function to return a complex result](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/faq/#faq-domain-errors) for negative arguments:
```
julia> quadgk(x -> 1/sqrt(complex(x)), -1, 0, 1)
(1.9999999891094182 - 1.9999999845983916im, 4.056765398346683e-8)
```
which correctly gives $\approx 2 - 2i$.  Note that we explicitly put an
endpoint at $x=0$ to tell `quadgk` about the singularity at that point,
as described above.

Or let's integrate the vector-valued function $f(x) = [1, x, x^2, x^3]$:
```
julia> quadgk(x -> [1,x,x^2,x^3], 0, 1)
([1.0, 0.5, 0.3333333333333333, 0.25], 6.206335383118183e-17)
```
which correctly returns $\approx [1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}]$.  Note that the error estimate
in this case is an approximate bound on the [norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)) of the error, as computed by the [`LinearAlgebra.norm`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#LinearAlgebra.norm) function in Julia.  It defaults to the Euclidean (L2) norm, but you can change this with the `norm`
argument:
```
julia> quadgk(x -> [1,x,x^2,x^3], 0, 1, norm=v->maximum(abs, v))
([1.0, 0.5, 0.3333333333333333, 0.25], 5.551115123125783e-17)
```
e.g. to use the [maximum norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance)
or some other norm (e.g. a weighted norm if the different components have different
units or have unequal error tolerances).

## Arbitrary-precision integrals

`quadgk` also supports [arbitrary-precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) using Julia's [`BigFloat` type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/numbers/#BigFloats-and-BigInts) to compute integrals to arbitrary accuracy (albeit at increased computational cost).

For example, we can compute the [error function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function) $\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \text{erf}(1) = \int_0^1 e^{-x^2} dx$ to 50 digits by:
```
julia> setprecision(60, base=10) # use 60-digit arithmetic
60

julia> quadgk_count(x -> exp(-x^2), big"0.0", big"1.0", rtol=1e-50)
(0.74682413281242702539946743613185300535449968681260632902766195, 6.8956257635323481758755998484087241330474674891762053644928492e-51, 15345)
```
The correct answer is `≈ 0.746824132812427025399467436131853005354499686812606329027654498958605…`, and
we are matching that to nearly the full precision (≈ 60 digits).  (As usual,
the error estimate of `quadgk` is very conservative for smooth functions.)

Unfortunately, it took 15345 function evaluations to obtain such an accurate
answer.  Since this a smooth integrand, for high-accuracy calculations it is
often advisable to increase the "order" of the quadrature algorithm (which
is related to the degree of polynomials used for interpolation).  The default
is `order=7`, but let's try tripling it to `order=21`:
```
julia> quadgk_count(x -> exp(-x^2), big"0.0", big"1.0", rtol=1e-50, order=21)
(0.74682413281242702539946743613185300535449968681260632902765324, 2.1873898701681913100611385149037136705674736373054902472850425e-58, 129)
```
It got the same accuracy (≈ 60 digits) with only 129 integrand evaluations!

## Contour integration

You can specify a sequence of points in the complex plane to perform a [contour integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_integration) with `quadgk` along a piecewise-linear contour.

For example, consider the function $f(z) = \cos(z)/z$.  By the
[residue theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_theorem)
of complex analysis, if we integrate counter-clockwise in a "loop"
around the [pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeros_and_poles) at
$z=0$, we should get exactly $2\pi i \cos(0) = 2\pi i$.

One way to do this integral is to [parameterize a contour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation), say a
circle $|z|=1$ parameterized by $z= e^{i\phi}$ (`= cis(ϕ)` in Julia), which gives $dz = i z\, d\phi$, to
obtain an ordinary integral $\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\cos(e^{i\phi})}{e^{i\phi}} ie^{i\phi} d\phi$ over the *real* parameter $\phi \in (0,2\pi)$:
```
julia> quadgk(ϕ -> cos(cis(ϕ)) * im, 0, 2π)
(0.0 + 6.283185307179586im, 1.8649646913725044e-8)
```
which indeed gives us $\approx 2\pi i$ (to machine precision).

As an alternative, however, you can directly supply a sequence of
*complex "endpoints"* to `quadgk` and it will perform the contour
integral along a sequence of line segments connecting these points.  For example, instead of integrating around a circular contour, we can integrate
around the diamond (rotated square) connecting the corners $\pm 1$ and $\pm i$:
```
julia> quadgk(z -> cos(z)/z, 1, im, -1, -im, 1)
(0.0 + 6.283185307179587im, 5.369976662961913e-9)
```
which again gives $\approx 2\pi i$ (to machine precision).  Note that it
is critically important to have a *closed* contour (a loop): the final
endpoint must be the same as the starting point ($z=1$).

## Cauchy principal values

Integrands $f(x) = g(x)/x$ that diverge $\sim 1/x$ cannot be integrated
through $x=0$ in the usual way (the singularity is not integrable).
However, if you integrate *around* $x=0$, for both signs of $x$, then you
can define a kind of integral that is the "difference" of the divergence
on the two sides.  This definition is called a [Cauchy principal value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_principal_value), and is usually presented
as a limit:
```math
\text{p.v.}\int_a^b \frac{g(x)}{x} dx =
\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0^+} \left[
    \int_a^{-\varepsilon} \frac{g(x)}{x} dx + \int_{+\varepsilon}^b \frac{g(x)}{x} dx
\right] \, .
```
That is, you subtract a "ball" of radius $\varepsilon$ from the integration
domain $a < 0 < b$ to eliminate the singularity at $x=0$, and take the limit of the resulting integral as the $\varepsilon$ goes to zero.

In principle, you might imagine taking this limit numerically by
extrapolation of numerical integrals for a sequence of $\varepsilon > 0$
values, perhaps using Richardson extrapolation via the [Richardson.jl package](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Richardson.jl).  However, it is
mathematically equivalent and *much* more efficient to use a simple
singularity-subtraction procedure:
```math
\frac{g(x)}{x}  =
\frac{g(x)-g(0)}{x} + \frac{g(0)}{x}
```
where the first term is *not singular* if $g(x)$ is differentiable at $x=0$,
and the latter term can be integrated analytically, giving:
```math
\text{p.v.}\int_a^b \frac{g(x)}{x} dx = \int_a^b \frac{g(x)-g(0)}{x} dx +
g(0) \log|b/a|
```
Since the remaining integral has no singularity, we can do it numerically
directly.  There are two tricks to help us a bit further:

* As in [Integrands with singularities and discontinuities](@ref) above, we'll want to put an extra endpoint at $x=0$ to make sure `quadgk` doesn't evaluate the integrand exactly at that point (which would give `NaN` from $0/0$).
* We should be careful with the integration tolerances, to make sure that any relative tolerance `rtol` is applied with respect to the whole principal part and not just to the $g(x)-g(0)$ integral.  An easy way to do this is to add $g(0) \frac{\log|b/a|}{b-a}$ to the *integrand*, so that we no longer compute the two pieces separately.

Putting it all together, here is a function `cauchy_quadgk(g, a, b)` that
computes our Cauchy principal part $\text{p.v.}\int_a^b g(x)/x$:
```
function cauchy_quadgk(g, a, b; kws...)
    a < 0 < b || throw(ArgumentError("domain must include 0"))
    g₀ = g(0)
    g₀int = b == -a ? zero(g₀) : g₀ * log(abs(b/a)) / (b - a)
    return quadgk_count(x -> (g(x)-g₀)/x + g₀int, a, 0, b; kws...)
end
```
For example, [Mathematica tells us](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=Integrate%5BCos%5Bx%5E2-1%5D%2Fx%2C+%7Bx%2C+-1%2C+2%7D%2C+PrincipalValue+-%3E+True%5D) that
```math
\text{p.v.} \int_{-1}^2 \frac{cos(x^2-1)}{x} dx \approx 0.212451309942989788929352736695\ldots ,
```
and we can reproduce this with `cauchy_quadgk`:
```
julia> cauchy_quadgk(x -> cos(x^2-1), -1, 2)
(0.21245130994298977, 1.8366794196644776e-11, 60)
```
which is correct to about 16 digits.

This approach and other approaches to computing Cauchy principal
values are discussed in [Keller and Wróbel (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2015.08.021).
This kind of "singularity subtraction" is a powerful approach to efficient
computation of integrals with singularities or near singularities.
A huge variety of related techniques have been developed for
[boundary element methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_element_method), where a vast number of singular integrals
must be computed and efficiency is at a premium.  See, for example,
[Reid *et al.* (2014)](http://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2367492) and
references therein.

## Nearly singular integrands

Even if the integrand is only *nearly* singular, so that there is a
sharp but *finite* peak within the integration domain, it can greatly
increase the efficiency of numerical integration if you can separate
the sharp peak analytically.

For example, suppose that you are integrating:
```math
I = \int_a^b \frac{g(x)}{x - i\alpha} dx
```
for a small $0 < \alpha \ll 1$.  For $\alpha \to 0^+$, it approaches $i\pi g(0)$ plus a Cauchy principal part (the latter being zero if $a = -b$ and $g(x)=g(-x)$), but for small $\alpha > 0$ you have to numerically integrate (for a general function $g(x)$) a function with a sharp spike at $x=0$, which will require a large number of quadrature points.  But you can subtract out the singularity analytically:
```math
I = \int_a^b \left[ \frac{g(x)-g(0)}{x - i\alpha} + \frac{g(0)}{x - i\alpha} \right] dx \\
= \int_a^b \frac{g(x)-g(0)}{x - i\alpha}dx + \underbrace{g(0) \left[\frac{1}{2}\log(x^2 + \alpha^2) + i\tan^{-1}(x/\alpha) \right]_a^b}_{I_0}
```
and then you only need to numerically integrate $I - I_0$, which has the spike subtracted.

As for [Cauchy principal values](@ref) above, we want to include
a $I_0 / (b-a)$ term directly in the integrand so that the error
tolerances are computedd correctly, and include $x=0$ as an explicit
endpoint to let `quadgk` know that the integral is badly behaved there.

In code:
```
using QuadGK

function int_slow(g, α, a, b; kws...)
    if a < 0 < b
        # put an explicit endpoint at x=0 since we know it is badly behaved there
        return quadgk_count(x -> g(x) / (x - im*α), a, 0, b; kws...)
    else
        return quadgk_count(x -> g(x) / (x - im*α), a, b; kws...)
    end
end

function int_fast(g, α, a, b; kws...)
    g₀ = g(0)
    denom_int(x) = log(x^2 + α^2)/2 + im * atan(x/α)
    I₀ = g₀ * (denom_int(b) - denom_int(a))
    if a < 0 < b
        # put an explicit endpoint at x=0 since we know it is badly behaved there
        (I,E,c) = quadgk_count(x -> I₀/(b-a) + (g(x) - g₀) / (x - im*α), a, 0, b; kws...)
    else
        (I,E,c) = quadgk_count(x -> I₀/(b-a) + (g(x) - g₀) / (x - im*α), a, b; kws...)
    end
    return (I,E,c+1) # add 1 for g(0) evaluation
end
```
This gives:
```
julia> int_slow(cos, 1e-6, -1, 1)
(1.1102230246251565e-16 + 3.1415896808206125im, 1.4895091715264936e-9, 1230)

julia> int_fast(cos, 1e-6, -1, 1)
(3.3306690738754696e-16 + 3.1415896808190418im, 1.8459683038047577e-12, 31)
```
which agree to about 13 digits, but the slow brute-force method requires 1230 function evaluations while the fast singularity-subtracted method requires only 31 function evaluations.

As an added bonus, `int_fast` works even for `α = 0`, where it gives you $i\pi g(0)$ (for $0 \in (a,b)$) plus the Cauchy principal part as above.
