This package provides support for one-dimensional numerical integration in Julia using adaptive
Gauss-Kronrod quadrature.
The code was originally part of Base Julia.

The package provides three functions: `quadgk`, `gauss`, and `kronrod`.
`quadgk` performs the integration, `gauss` computes Gaussian quadrature points and weights for integrating
over the interval [-1, 1], and `kronrod` computes Kronrod points, weights, and embedded Gaussian quadrature
weights for integrating over [-1, 1].

For more information, see the documentation.

## Similar packages

The [FastGaussQuadrature.jl](https://github.com/ajt60gaibb/FastGaussQuadrature.jl) package provides
non-adaptive Gaussian quadrature with a wider variety of weight functions.
It should be preferred to this package for higher orders *N*, since the algorithms here are
*O*(*N*<sup>2</sup>) whereas the FastGaussQuadrature algorithms are *O*(*N*).

For multidimensional integration, see the [Cubature.jl](https://github.com/stevengj/Cubature.jl) and
[Cuba.jl](https://github.com/giordano/Cuba.jl) packages.
